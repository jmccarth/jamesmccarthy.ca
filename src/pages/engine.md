ENGINE (ENcoding Geospatial INformation and Expertise) is a knowledge translation framework and implementation I built as part of my Masters work at the University of Windsor. It's purpose was to take descriptions of sensors and their observations encoded in the OGC's SensorML and O&M specifications and convert them into an ontological representation to be used withing a geospatial reasoning engine.

More information can be found in the Sensors article listed on the publications page.
