BoreIS (Borehole Information System) was an undergrad Thesis project I completed at the University of Windsor. It was an ArcScene 8.x and 9.x extension used to visualize borehole data and was my first venture into knowledge representation. More information can be foundÂ in the Computers & Geosciences (2006) article listed on the Publications page.
